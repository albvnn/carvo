# Carvo

Carvo is a **fictional SaaS landing page** for a car rental management platform, created as a student project for the TI402I 2024/2025 Web Programming course. This project demonstrates modern web design, branding, and eco-friendly SaaS concepts. **Carvo is not a real product or service.**

## 🌱 Project Overview

- **Features:**
  - Modern, clean, and responsive design
  - About, Features, and Pricing pages
  - Team and Sustainability mission sections
  - Contact form with validation and recap
  - Consistent card-based UI
- **Sustainability:** Highlights how a car rental SaaS could help reduce carbon footprint and support UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (semantic, accessible markup)
- **CSS3** (custom styles, responsive layout, card system)
- **JavaScript** (vanilla, for form validation and interactivity)
- **No frameworks or build tools required**

## ✨ How to Run
1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` or `about.html` in your browser. No build step or server required.

## 📨 Contact Form
- Located at the bottom of `about.html`.
- Users must enter their name, email, enterprise, and message.
- All fields are required and validated (including email format).
- On submit, the form is replaced with a recap card showing the entered info and a "Message sent!" confirmation.
- The form and recap use the same card style as the rest of the site for a consistent look.

- Responsive and accessible

## 🌍 Sustainability Mission
Carvo is designed to show how digital tools can help car rental companies reduce their environmental impact and support the UN SDGs (Goals 11 & 13).
